### Artwall
this template added an "art wall" of three photos on a wide screen, inspired by this Globe & Mail story:

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-north/the-magnetic-north/article16364070/

However, just before launch for 8/31, it was found to not work in IE an even in some versions of Chrome. The screen was blank where the artwall should appear. I didn't have time to troubleshoot it.
